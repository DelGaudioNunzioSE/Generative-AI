# Generative-AI
This repository is the result of a university project aimed at testing conditional face generation using VAE, GAN, and DDPM models.

## Training Notes
We used the CelebA dataset for training.
The training code expects the CelebA dataset to be downloaded into the project directory.
It is recommended to review and adjust the dataset paths specified in the main script as needed.
